    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      At Fresh Farm Organics, we believe that good food begins with good soil and a whole lot of care. Tucked away in peaceful countryside, our family-run farm is home to fields of vibrant fruits and vegetables, and a happy herd of cows, goats, and sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      From juicy strawberries to creamy yogurt and hand-crafted cheeses, everything we produce is rooted in a commitment to natural farming and ethical animal care. Our animals are free to roam, graze, and live well — because we know that happy animals make better dairy.
    </p>
    <p>
      We grow with the seasons, harvest by hand, and keep things simple — just the way nature intended. No chemicals, no shortcuts, just fresh, nourishing food from our farm to your family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're picking up a veg box, enjoying a block of our creamy goat cheese, or visiting us for the first time — welcome to the farm. We're so glad you're here.
